# The Odin Project - Etch-A-Sketch

The Etch-A-Sketch App is a dynamic and interactive application that allows you to create colorful drawings on a grid of square divs. This project provides a customizable grid of square divs that you can color by hovering your mouse over them. The app includes features for color randomization and progressive darkening, along with the ability to clear the grid and specify the number of squares per side for a new drawing canvas.

## Features

Dynamic Grid: The application provides a dynamic grid of square divs. You can specify the number of squares per side for your drawing canvas, making it highly customizable.

Interactive Coloring: Hover your mouse over the grid squares, and they change color, allowing you to create colorful drawings. Move your mouse to create a pixelated trail through the grid.

Color Randomization: With each interaction, the square's color is randomized for added creativity and variety in your artwork.

Progressive Darkening: The application features a progressive darkening effect where each interaction adds 10% more black or color to the square, allowing you to create shading and depth in your drawings.

Clear and Reset: The app includes a button at the top of the screen that lets you clear the existing drawing and start with a fresh canvas. You can also specify the number of squares per side for the new grid.

User Input Validation: The input for the number of squares per side is limited to a maximum of 100 to prevent performance issues with larger grids.
