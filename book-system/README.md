# The Odin Project - Library

This app is a web-based book cataloging tool that allows users to add, display, remove, and update the read status of books in a virtual library. Users can input book details, such as author, title, and page count, using a form. The app then stores and displays these books, providing options to remove them from the library and mark them as read or unread. It serves as a simple way to manage and organize a personal book collection online.
